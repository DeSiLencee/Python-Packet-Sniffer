Hello,

When installing this code, you must install it according to the operating system.
**If you are using Linux Systems, install LIN_sniffer.py otherwise WIN_sniffer.py.

Attention!

If you'll use WIN_sniffer.py, you must set your local IPv4 Address on 25th line in the code.

->You can find your IPv4 Address using " ipconfig " in CMD.

->Do not need to set your IPv4 Address on Linux systems.

*** Both code must run as an administrator !!

->In Linux systems, you must run the code using " sudo " command.

->In Windows, you must run your IDE as an administrator.
